Hello, Neovim users!

After what feels like an eternity, there is now a new module: ['mini.cmdline'](/mini.nvim/readmes/mini-cmdline.md).

The 'mini.nvim' is long overdue a new 0.17 release. After contemplating a "just do it" approach, I decided that keeping the "every release has at least one new module" streak is worth it.

So after looking for which module would be the most beneficial while taking not-so-long to write, the choice fell on implementing various Neovim command line tweaks.

------

Features of 'mini.cmdline':

- Autocomplete with customizable delay. This is basically an automated pressing of [`'wildchar'`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/helptag.html?tag='wildchar') (`<Tab>` by default) with some extra configuration possibilities. Proved to be more useful than I anticipated.

    Requires Neovim>=0.11, though Neovim>=0.12 is recommended.

- Autocorrect words as-you-type. Only words that must come from a fixed set of candidates (like commands and options) are autocorrected by default.

- Autopeek command range as-you-type. Shows a floating window with range lines along with customizable context lines. Looks really cool!

What it doesn't do:

- Customization of command line UI. Hopefully [`:h vim._extui`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/helptag.html?tag=vim._extui) will be enough for that (on Neovim>=0.12).

- Customization of autocompletion candidates. They are computed via [`:h cmdline-completion`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/helptag.html?tag=cmdline-completion) based on how current command defines its completion.

Please, check it out and tell me what you think! For the time being (until there are comments on the site) leave a comment in a dedicated [beta-testing issue](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/issues/2158).

I'd like to make 0.17 release relatively soon, so extensive public beta-testing will help a lot.

Thanks!
